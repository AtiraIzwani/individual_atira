This page features some of my experiences from school days to the present. For example, in terms of part -time work, sports and even some of the activities I used to do. No one can live without learning something. What we learn and experience brings benefits in our daily lives. <br><br>

<p style="color:gray;"><b> I used to be an assistant to a kindergarten teacher in 2019 before continuing my studies at university (UITM). I had the opportunity to learn a variety of things and participate in programs organized by the kindergarten where I work. Among them, I once participated in a swimming program, where students were taken to the stadium to learn the sport of swimming taught by professionals. In addition, archery programs, horseback riding and more. Here, I learned how to teach and manage kindergarten children even in a short time. It was a very exciting opportunity and would definitely do it again if I had the chance.</b></p></center>

<p style="color:gray;"><b> In 2016, I participated in the sport of Frisbee representing my school along with other friends. It was the first Frisbee sport to be introduced in schools. I was the first group to be trained in this sport in my high school. I along with other friends then continued to be involved in this sport for two years in a row. It was a very meaningful experience for me.</b></p></center>
